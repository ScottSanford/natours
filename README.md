## Reflection
This was a project built during the [Udemy Course: Advanced CSS & SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) Project goals included... 

* SASS fundamentals
* BEM Methodology
* Float layouts (Grid Layout)
* Relative/Absolute Positioning
* CSS animations
* Responsive Design
* Font-size rem/em units

One of the key learning lessons from this project was the importance of CSS code structure. Seperation of Concerns is a key component to a maintainable codebase. Having a dedicated file to common CSS values `_variables.scss` was very important for this project.
